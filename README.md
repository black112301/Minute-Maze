# Minute Maze

## 📝 About

Minute Maze is a procedural 3D maze simulator where the player has one minute to escape.

Built using [Unity2D](https://unity.com/) and C#. 
Most models and animations were made by me using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). 
More info on the maze generation process can be found at [Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/).

Credits for the sound effects goes to [SoundBible](https://soundbible.com/).
